                        <p>Raghuveer is one of the most enthusiastic person in our team. He's full of energy and
                            cheers up the team and an excellent team player. Release Engineering is one of the teams
                            where one will have to attend top priority issues at any time. Raghuveer takes up
                            challenges and ensures that the issue is resolved with utmost care and dedication. His
                            thought process have helped the day to day activities a lot, especially coming up with
                            new ideas and rethinking the existing processes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another remarkable thing is his proficiency in Perl scripting. His out of the box
                            thinking for getting things done in a timely fashion is admirable. I strongly recommend
                            Raghuveer for any team that values team work & new ideas.

                        <p>Raghuveer helped the Ariba Engineering Services/Release Control team to implement a
                            stable CI pipeline. He is hard working, detail oriented and likes to keep all
                            tools/processes simple and clean. He has a deep understanding of various tools in the CI
                            pipeline. He is passionate about UI technologies as well. He will be a valuable asset to
                            any engineering team.

                        <p>Raghuveer is a diligent performer along with being responsive and efficient at the same
                            time. I have interacted with his team on a cross team basis, mostly as an internal
                            customer, and have found him to be really good at communicating problem solution
                            efficiently from both his and my team's perspective. He does not hesitate to go beyond
                            the scope of immediate requests to suggest better ways of handling things. As an
                            engineer, I value his skills and knowledge at investigating the issues at hand, coming
                            up with a solution and collaborating with other teams in executing it. He does not
                            restrict himself to his team's code base, but is also constantly willing to explore new
                            technologies. This blend of skills makes him a valuable, high performing asset for any
                            team.

                        <p>In my experience, the ability to maintain focus on details that matter is not always
                            found along side the traits of 'calm and happy". Raghuveer is that increasingly rare
                            individual that has this combination and also knows what he is talking about. He will
                            cope well with the ambiguity in your project and likely will discern the real pressure
                            points early in the game. He is not going to need a lot of direction as he does it. I
                            doubt he will be available very often or for very long. If his is you should investigate
                            his capabilities before your competitor does.
