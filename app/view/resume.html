                            <p>Raghuveer is a diligent performer along with being responsive and efficient at the same
                                time. I have interacted with his team on a cross team basis, mostly as an internal
                                customer, and have found him to be really good at communicating problem solution
                                efficiently from both his and my team's perspective. He does not hesitate to go beyond
                                the scope of immediate requests to suggest better ways of handling things. As an
                                engineer, I value his skills and knowledge at investigating the issues at hand, coming
                                up with a solution and collaborating with other teams in executing it. He does not
                                restrict himself to his team's code base, but is also constantly willing to explore new
                                technologies. This blend of skills makes him a valuable, high performing asset for any
                                team.
